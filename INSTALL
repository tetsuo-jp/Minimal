Minimal is available under a BSD license.
You are free to use and modify it as you wish.

To compile it, you need the Objective Caml compiler, version 3.01 or newer.
You can find it at:
        http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html

The just try
        make

By default, the native code version is built, with the graphics
extension enabled.  If either you don't have the graphics library,
you can compile with "make minimal-nograph". If you can only compile
to bytecode, go to the src directory and try "make minimal-byte".

Then you can either install unix-style with
        make install

or to a single directory with
        make install-hier PREFIX=<directory>
